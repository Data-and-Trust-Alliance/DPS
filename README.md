## TODO

Punch List of work to do:

- Style (css) to produce numbered headers and anything else we want customized
- Need a canonical root from which all the technical needs reference. This is a technical anchor. It could be based on the dataandtrustalliance.org DNS, but could/should be ultimately at the standards body that publishes this specification
  - am using `https://github.com/Data-and-Trust-Alliance/DPS/` today
- Security Considerations
- Review top-to-bottom for readability, flow, and completeness

- Reference GIThub repo with reference implementation and sample applications
- Need at least one of the technical formats drafted, and place holder for the other two. 
  - These can be defined only using the technical formats and given examples
  - Thus we have three GIThub repos for JSON, XML, and YAML.
